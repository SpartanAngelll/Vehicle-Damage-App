# Service Professional Chat Integration Fix

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**
Service professionals were not receiving chat messages because they had no way to access or view chat conversations. The service professional dashboard only had 3 tabs: "Service Requests", "My Estimates", and "Profile" - there was no chat functionality at all.

## 🛠️ **Root Cause**
The service professional dashboard (`RepairProfessionalDashboard`) was missing:
1. **Chat Tab**: No way to view active chat conversations
2. **Chat Service Integration**: No connection to the chat service
3. **Message Notifications**: No way to see when customers send messages
4. **Chat Navigation**: No way to open and respond to chat conversations

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Added Chat Tab to Service Professional Dashboard**
- **Updated TabController**: Changed from 3 tabs to 4 tabs
- **Added Chat Tab**: New tab with chat icon and "Chat" label
- **Updated TabBarView**: Added chat tab to the tab view

### **2. Integrated Chat Service**
- **Imported ChatService**: Added chat service dependency
- **Added ChatService Instance**: Created `_chatService` instance
- **Connected to Chat Streams**: Integrated with `getUserChatRoomsStream()`

### **3. Created Chat Tab UI**
- **Real-time Chat List**: Shows all active chat conversations
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no chats exist
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states with retry functionality
- **Chat Room Cards**: Beautiful cards showing:
  - Customer profile photo
  - Customer name
  - Last message preview
  - Timestamp (e.g., "2h ago", "Just now")
  - Navigation arrow

### **4. Added Chat Navigation**
- **Tap to Open**: Tapping a chat card opens the full chat screen
- **Proper Navigation**: Uses `ChatScreen` with correct parameters
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains chat room ID and customer info

### **5. Added Helper Methods**
- **`_formatLastMessageTime()`**: Formats timestamps in user-friendly format
- **Time Formatting**: Shows "Just now", "5m ago", "2h ago", "3d ago"
