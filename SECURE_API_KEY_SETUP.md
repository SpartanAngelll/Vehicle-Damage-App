# Secure Google Maps API Key Configuration

## ✅ **Security Implementation Complete**

Your Google Maps API key is now configured securely using the following approach:

### **🔒 Security Features Implemented:**

1. **Local Properties File**: API key stored in `android/local.properties` (already in `.gitignore`)
2. **Build Configuration**: API key injected at build time from local properties
3. **No Hardcoding**: API key is not hardcoded in any source files
4. **Version Control Safe**: `local.properties` is ignored by git, preventing accidental commits

### **📁 Files Modified:**

- ✅ `android/local.properties` - Contains your API key (not committed to git)
- ✅ `android/app/build.gradle.kts` - Build configuration to read from local properties
- ✅ `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Uses build config field
- ✅ `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` - Removed hardcoded key

### **🛡️ Security Benefits:**

- **No Accidental Exposure**: API key cannot be accidentally committed to version control
- **Environment Specific**: Each developer can have their own API key
- **Build Time Injection**: Key is only available during build process
- **No Source Code Exposure**: Key is not visible in any source files

### **🚀 How It Works:**

1. **Build Time**: Gradle reads API key from `local.properties`
2. **Injection**: Key is injected as a build config field
3. **Manifest**: AndroidManifest.xml uses the injected value
4. **Runtime**: Google Maps SDK receives the key securely

### **📋 Current Configuration:**

Your API key `AIzaSyDf_kWsC-UjIrP6iDqv2iHGV3oVVXjm2Ik` is now:
- ✅ Stored in `android/local.properties` (secure)
- ✅ Injected at build time (secure)
- ✅ Not visible in source code (secure)
- ✅ Protected from version control (secure)

### **🔄 For Other Developers:**

When other developers clone the project, they need to:
1. Create their own `android/local.properties` file
2. Add their own Google Maps API key
3. The app will work with their key

### **⚠️ Important Security Notes:**

- **Never commit** `android/local.properties` to version control
- **Restrict your API key** in Google Cloud Console to your app's package name
- **Set up billing** on your Google Cloud project
- **Monitor usage** in Google Cloud Console

### **🧪 Testing:**

1. **Hot restart** the app (not just hot reload)
2. **Navigate to** service professional profile
3. **Tap "Set Location"** - the map should now load with your API key
4. **Verify** the map is interactive and functional

Your Google Maps integration is now secure and ready to use! 🎉
